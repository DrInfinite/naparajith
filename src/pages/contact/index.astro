				<summary>Why is there no Contact Form?</summary>
				<p>
					A contact form requires the downloading and execution of client-side
					JavaScript. While this can be implemented easily, the JS code will
					become obfuscated on build.
				</p>
				<p>
					This goes against my current vision to build a website that has little
					to zero non-free and obfuscated JavaScript. Therefore, for the moment,
					so such form exists.
				</p>
				<p>
					A contact form may exist in the future, but not now. And no guarantee
					is made on a timeline of its implementation.
