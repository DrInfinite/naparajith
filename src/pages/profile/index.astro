        <h3>More about me</h3>
        <p>
            Many people are curious about my name and what it means. So here is
            your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name Naparajith is deeply rooted in ancient Indian culture and
            roughly translates to <strong>
                <em>
                    "<u>a person who is undefeated.</u>"
                </em>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is my name translated into a few regional languages, just as a
            sign of my respect for the immense diversity of this wonderful
            nation.
        </p>

            <caption class="mb-4 font-semibold italic">
                Translations in select Indian languages
            </caption>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Language</th>
                    <th>Name</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                {
                    translations.map(({ lang, name }) => (
                        <tr>
                            <td>{lang}</td>
                            <td class="font-sans">{name}</td>
                        </tr>
                    ))
                }
