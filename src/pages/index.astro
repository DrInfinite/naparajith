				When I was a kid, I was told a really inspiring quote about learning,
				which goes something like this:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<blockquote
					cite={process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
						? "http://localhost:4321/"
						: "https://naparajith.vercel.app/"}
				>
					From the teacher is learned a quarter, a quarter from the student's
					own intelligence, a quarter from fellow students, and a quarter with
					the passage of time.
				</blockquote>

				I intened to make learning my long-term commitment, and that takes a lot
				of support, effort and cooperation. Here are a few things I'm interested
				in getting help on (not an exhaustive list):
			</p>
			<ol>
				{learning.map((concept) => <li>{concept}</li>)}
			</ol>
			<p>
				If you would like to help me in any of these ways, please write to <A
