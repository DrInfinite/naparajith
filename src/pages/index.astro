				When I was a kid, I was told a really inspiring quote about
				learning, which goes something like this:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<blockquote cite={"Unknown Hindu Shloka"}>
					From the teacher is learned a quarter, a quarter from the
					student's own intelligence, a quarter from fellow students,
					and a quarter with the passage of time.
				</blockquote>

				I intened to make learning my long-term commitment, and that
				takes a lot of support, effort and cooperation. Here are a few
				things I'm interested in getting help on (not an exhaustive
				list):
			</p>
			<ol>
				{learning.map((concept) => <li>{concept}</li>)}
			</ol>
			<p>
				If you would like to help me in any of these ways, please write
