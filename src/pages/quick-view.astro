			<summary>Why is there no Contact Form?</summary>
			<p>
				A contact form requires a good amount of client-side JS. I currently
				have no idea on how to make this client-side code as transparent and as
				open as possible to the end user. I also don't have an idea as to how to
				pull this off without any JS (if that's even possible). Therefore, for
				the moment, so such form exists.
			</p>
			<p>
				A contact form may exist in the future, but not now. And no guarantee is
				made on a timeline of when it will.
