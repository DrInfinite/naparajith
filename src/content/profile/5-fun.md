I'm the first of my kind: a **Pan-Indian Person**, assembled with parts sourced
from across India. It was a long manufacturing process, but I was finally
released for production in November of 2002. And boy, was it a defect-ridden
product or what? :D

When I'm not busy debugging my code, I enjoy watching YouTube videos of cats
playing the piano, listening to music in languages I don't understand, reading
about historical events, and building family tree charts for historical
characters. Oh, and I also enjoy cricket! Who doesn't love staring at a field of
people in white clothes for hours, waiting for something to happen? :D

And no, **Naparajith** is not a real name. It's just something I made up to
sound cool. You can call me _Naps_ (but only if you're cool enough to be friends
with me).
