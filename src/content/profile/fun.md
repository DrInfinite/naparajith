I'm the first of my kind: a **Pan-Indian Person**, assembled with parts sourced from 4 different states. It was a 9-month long manufacturing process, but I was finally released for production in November of 2002. And boy, was it a defect-ridden product or what? :D

When I'm not busy debugging my code, I enjoy watching YouTube videos of cats playing the piano, listening to music in languages I don't understand, reading about historical events that didn't happen, and building family tree charts for fictional characters. Oh, and I also enjoy cricket! Who doesn't love staring at a field of people in white clothes for hours, waiting for something to happen? :D

And no, **Naparajith** is not a real name. It's just something I made up to sound cool. You can call me _Naps_ (but only if you're cool enough to be friends with me).
