# The Overhyping of Artificial Intelligence

Over the past few years, AI has made tremendous progress in innovation and growth, with the industry adopting it at an unprecedented rate. The release of ChatGPT 3.5 in 2023 was a major turning point, marking a significant shift in how AI is perceived and used. The world has not been the same since.

## The AI Boom

The rapid growth of AI has led to a race to build newer, better AI models that can process larger inputs, provide results faster, and even reason and think on their own. These models are capable of providing solutions with a level of accuracy and depth never thought possible before.

## The Doomsday Predictions

However, this growth has also led to a host of doomsday predictions. Many people believe that AI will take over the world, replace human jobs, and even break through our safety nets and defense systems. These predictions are not only alarming but also unrealistic.

## The Unspoken Truth

There is an unspoken truth in this entire conversation. A truth that might change the way we view AI. The almost unrealistic expectations that we have placed on AI have turned what should have been a tool to enhance our productivity into something it was never meant to be: an alternate or substitute for human thought and effort.

## The Silent Pandemic

This is a silent pandemic that has risen with the dawn of AI. With the release of better and more capable models, it is not only spreading to more humans but is becoming more severe in humans who are already dependent on AI for more than they should be. It is time for us to take a step back and reevaluate our relationship with AI.
