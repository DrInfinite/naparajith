### From Foundling to Healer: The Early Years

Jīvaka's story began with mystery and fate. Abandoned as a child, he was discovered by the royal court of King Bimbisāra, where he was raised and nurtured. Despite his humble and uncertain beginnings, Jīvaka’s intellect and potential shone through. With an insatiable desire to learn, he journeyed to the ancient city of Takṣaśilā, a center of wisdom, where he honed his skills in medicine under a revered teacher. After seven years of rigorous study, he returned to Rājagṛha, where his talent as a healer would soon alter the course of history.

### A Sacred Calling: Medicine Meets the Buddha

Jīvaka’s medical skills quickly earned him a place in the royal court, serving as the trusted physician to King Bimbisāra. But it was his fateful encounter with the Buddha that would shape his life’s mission. As Jīvaka spent more time with the Buddha and his followers, he became a staunch supporter of the faith, intertwining his role as a healer with his growing spiritual devotion. His medical expertise was invaluable to the Buddha and his disciples, and in time, Jīvaka founded the Jīvakarāma Monastery, a lasting symbol of his dedication to both healing and the Buddhist path.

### Royal Turmoil: A Healer's Role in the Kingdom

The winds of political change swept through the royal court when King Bimbisāra was tragically murdered by his own son, Ajatashatru. Jīvaka’s role in the kingdom became even more crucial as he navigated the delicate balance of loyalty and healing. When Ajatashatru, burdened by guilt, sought redemption, Jīvaka facilitated his meeting with the Buddha. This pivotal moment marked a profound spiritual turning point for the new king, as he repented for his actions and began his own journey toward enlightenment. The medical feats attributed to Jīvaka, including intricate surgeries that some scholars believe involved brain surgery, remain a testament to his unparalleled skill, though the true historical accuracy of these tales remains a subject of debate.

### The Eternal Legacy: A Healer and Saint

Jīvaka’s legacy transcended the royal courts and the healing arts. Across India, Thailand, and beyond, he is honored as a patron of traditional medicine, revered not only for his medical wisdom but also for his profound connection to Buddhism. His role in spreading the Buddha’s teachings helped solidify the faith’s presence across Asia, and his memory lives on through ceremonies and practices surrounding Thai traditional medicine. The Jīvakarāma Monastery, identified by the Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang in the 7th century and later excavated, stands as a historical monument to Jīvaka's contributions.
