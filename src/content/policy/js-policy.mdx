## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to inform the user that only open source
JavaScript (FOSS JavaScript) is used across my website and there are no
restrictions on it. By leveraging freely available and unrestricted FOSS
JavaScript, I can benefit from a wide range of functionality and capabilities to
enhance the user experience of my website.

This policy establishes my commitment to respecting the open source ethos and
contributing back to the community where possible. It will provide me with a
clear understanding of how to appropriately incorporate FOSS JavaScript into my
project while maintaining the intended spirit of open source software.

## Scope

This policy applies to the use of free and unrestricted FOSS JavaScript across
my entire website project. I am committed to exclusively using FOSS JavaScript
components that have the most permissive licenses, such as MIT, Apache, or BSD,
which allow for unrestricted use, modification, and distribution.

The policy does not constrain the use of FOSS JavaScript for internal or
external purposes. I am free to incorporate any FOSS JavaScript libraries,
frameworks, or utilities that meet the criteria of being free and unrestricted,
without the need for additional approval or compliance procedures.

My goal is to leverage the vast ecosystem of open source JavaScript to create a
robust and feature-rich website for my users, while respecting the open source
principles of freedom and collaboration.

## Terms and Abbreviations

| Term                          | Abbreviation  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| JavaScript                    | **JS**        |
| kB                            | **KiloBytes** |
| Free and Open Source Software | **FOSS**      |

## Policy

There are several chunks of JavaScript that are executed to maintain a smooth
user experience across the site. A few kB of JS is shipped and executed in the
client for prefetching routes, handling dates, improving user navigation,
switching between light and dark mode and fetching dynamic content.

While the site may function as intended with JS blocked, some aspects may not be
in the way the user expects. Some elements may break when JS is disabled.

The following JS is executed on client-side to automatically set the theme based
on the Browser/OS theme.

```js
<script is:inline>
 const getThemePreference = () => {
  if (typeof localStorage !== 'undefined' && localStorage.getItem('theme')) {
   return localStorage.getItem('theme');
  }
  return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light';
 };
 const isDark = getThemePreference() === 'dark';
 document.documentElement.classList[isDark ? 'add' : 'remove']('dark');

 if (typeof localStorage !== 'undefined') {
  const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
   const isDark = document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark');
   localStorage.setItem('theme', isDark ? 'dark' : 'light');
  });
  observer.observe(document.documentElement, { attributes: true, attributeFilter: ['class'] });
 }
</script>
```

### Disabling JavaScript

Disabling JS doesn't affect any of the site's core functionality, but the site
is forced to be in light mode.

If you are not comfortable with client-side script execution, don't like
unauthorized access to local storage or just simply don't like non-free
JavaScript, you can proceed by disabling JS for this site in particular or by
installing the <A href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/librejs/" target="_blank">LibreJS extension
</A> (only works on Firefox-based browsers). Learn more about it <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/" target="_blank">here</A>.

changes will be appreciated. Please send comments to
