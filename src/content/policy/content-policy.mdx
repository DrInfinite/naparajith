## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to inform the user that a strict content policy is
used across my website and there are no restrictions on viewing and
re-distributing it. By adhering to a strict content guideline, I am able to
ensure that there is a reasonable amount of integrity and authenticity within my
website.

## Scope

This policy applies to the use of free and unrestricted FOSS JavaScript across
my entire website project. I am committed to exclusively using FOSS JavaScript
components that have the most permissive licenses, such as MIT, Apache, or BSD,
which allow for unrestricted use, modification, and distribution.

The policy does not constrain the use of FOSS JavaScript for internal or
external purposes. I am free to incorporate any FOSS JavaScript libraries,
frameworks, or utilities that meet the criteria of being free and unrestricted,
without the need for additional approval or compliance procedures.

My goal is to leverage the vast ecosystem of open source JavaScript to create a
robust and feature-rich website for my users, while respecting the open source
principles of freedom and collaboration.

## Policy
