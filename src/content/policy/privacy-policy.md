## API Policy

This site references several third-party APIs to provide a better overall experience. An exhaustive list of such services may be found below:

1. GitHub REST API
2. LeetCode GraphQL API

## Link Policy

Across the site, I have linked to various internal and external sources. I follow a set of policies while linking you to said sources. The policies are listed below.

### Links to Internal Sources

1. All links within the website do not have any type of analytics or tracking embedded.
2. With internal links, what you see is what you get.
3. Some JS may be fetched and executed to ensure a smooth and consistent experience.
4. The site and its various pages contain no NSFW or explicit content. All content adheres to a strict code.

### Links to External Sources

1. Any and all mentioned external links may contain non-free, commercial JavaScript for cookies, analytics and tracking.
2. I neither endorse nor reject any linked sites, their owners, their business models, their personal or their political views unless explicitly stated.
3. Externally linked sources may contain text, images or videos that may or may not suite the viewer. Either way, I take zero responsibility for appealing to or hurting the viewer's sentiments.
4. No external links link to NSFW or explicit content. All content adheres to a strict code.

## JavaScript Policy

There are several chunks of JavaScript that are executed to maintain a smooth user experience across the site. A few kB of JS is shipped and executed in the client for prefetching routes and for ViewTransitions.

### JavaScript for ViewTransitions

There is about 12.13 kB (gzipped: 4.17 kB) worth of JS that is crucial towards enabling ViewTransitions in your browser. While it is non-essential in FireFox based browsers and Safari, which lack support for the feature, it is necessary to ensure a smooth experience on Chromium-based browsers. Disabling JS doesn't affect any of the site's core functionality, but does remove the smooth page transitions that are a staple of Single Page Applications.

If you are not comfortable with script execution, don't like unauthorized access to local storage or just simply don't like non-free JavaScript, you can proceed by disabling JS for this site in particular or by installing the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/librejs/" target="_blank">LibreJS</a> extension (only works on Mozilla-based browsers). Learn more about it <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/" target="_blank">here</a>.
