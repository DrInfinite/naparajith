title: Not So Professional Bio
---

You've seen Pan-Indian Movies, Pan-Indian Songs, and even Pan-Indian Policies. But have you ever seen a Pan-Indian Person? That's right! With parts sourced from 4 different states, I was manufactured and assembled over a 9 month period, releasing for production in November of 2002.

My hobbies include watching YouTube, Horror Movies and Cricket Matches, listen to music irrespective of language, reading-up on historical events, building family tree charts for historical figures and programming: someone decided to pay me to do it ;)

Naparajith is just a formal name, you can call me **_Naps_**
